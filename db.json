Peering through Miss Tait’s window (illustrated here by John Lawrence), the children are astounded to see that 'Tommy the outcast' has brought driftwood for her fire and is contentedly eating an apple in her armchair. Miss Tait sees the children and invites them inside to eat and to receive a gift of a pound coin. In many of Brown’s tales and poems, outcasts and eccentrics like Tommy have a deeper spiritual understanding of the world around them and, in this case, of the true meaning of Christmas. This tale is unusual, though, for its topical references. Miss Tait has been without coal since the outbreak of the 1984 Miners’ Strike. The 'shiny pound coin' was first introduced in 1983. Often criticized for resisting progress and yearning for the past, Brown shows himself to be alive to contemporary developments.",

Teiglach was my grandmother’s crowning dish, a delicacy that she made once a year for a sweet Rosh Hashanah. Even in the 1950s, few of her friends even attempted it, and the version offered up in bakeries was a soggy imitation of her gooey, candy-like confection.",

According to the artist’s son, Robin McClure, former Director of Painting at The Scottish Gallery, ‘the linking of religious content to current strife and bloodshed was very much part of [McClure’s] publicly viewable work at the time’. Beginning with 'a series of enigmatic religiously-themed works' in the early 1960s, his paintings became more 'biting, gruesome and specific in their references', largely due to the ‘much publicized and often graphic’ media images of the First Mafia War, which broke out in 1962 in Sicily, where McClure had earlier lived and worked. We should like to thank Robin McClure for permission to exhibit his father’s design and for commenting on his father’s work.",

            "notes": "The economic basis for professional black and white photography in Cameroon disappeared in 1998 with the introduction of new identity cards. They were issued with instant photographs, removing the need for 'passport photographs'. A small supporting industry of photographers, such as have been celebrated in exhibitions e.g. of the work of Seidou Keita, has effectively been destroyed. One such studio photographer is Jacques Toussele, with a collection of some 20,000 negatives, but who is aging and is not in the best of health. He can recognise many of the people in the photographs, enabling future research to be undertaken, thus greatly enhancing the importance of the archive. African black and white photography has been recognised as important through some celebrated exhibitions and publications (e.g. of Sidibé, Augustt and Keita) but this has not translated into action to preserve the work of other photographers. The aim of the project was to help protect the personal photographic archives of Mr J Toussele, a Cameroonian photographer in the town of Mbouda, Western Region, Cameroon. The archives represent a record of life in this area over the past thirty years.",

            "notes": "Hailed as the new Raphael, Parmigianino was one of the most influential artists of the sixteenth century, cultivating a mannered gracefulness of pose and physiognomy, combined with new and dramatic coloristic effects, that transformed the classicism of his Renaissance predecessors. Here, he draws upon the work of Leonardo, Raphael, and Michelangelo in counterposing the serenely pensive Virgin with her active Son, who tugs at his mother’s veil. But the compressed pose of the Christ Child and the tall, sweeping foreheads of mother and child introduce elements of Parmigianino’s distinctive Mannerism. The Virgin’s exquisite beauty is an outward sign of her inner grace, which Parmigianino reinforces through the golden strands of her ribboned hair and the fluid rhythms of her gossamer drapery.",
